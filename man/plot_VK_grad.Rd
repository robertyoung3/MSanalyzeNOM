}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a tibble containing the assigned molecular formulas}

\item{plot_title}{a character string containing the sample name}
}
\description{
This function makes a traditional van Krevelen diagram (H/c vs. O/C). This
plot shows the distribution of the assigned formulas as a function of
elemental ratios, and shows the intensities of the detected ions on a
gradient color scale.
}
\details{
The area above the horizontal line at H/C = 1.5 is designated as the
aliphatic region in accordance with D'Andrilli et al. 2015 and Lv et al.
2017. The area below the diagonal line from H/C = 1.1 is designated as the
aromatic region based on a modified aromaticity index >= 0.5 in accordance
with Koch & Dittmar 2006.
