To-do list:

1. test for inclusion in the element_list when computing elemental ratios: is there a need?
2. compute KMD_CH2 and theor_KMD_CH2
3. create function to eliminate LAS and other known laboratory contaminants once KMD series have been computed
4. create a plot for H/C vs C number, O/C vs C number, DBE vs C number
5. create factor variable for CHO, CHNO, CHOS, and CHNOS
6. create factor variable for mass ranges (use modulus 100 to set range)
7. create bar plot for factor variables as a function of rel. abund. &  formula number
8. plot O classes on same basis
9. plot N and S classes on this basis (one plot per N or S number)
10. compute aromaticity indexes
11. compute NOSC
12. create Kroll diagram

3. perform a study comparing KMD_CH2 and theor_KMD_CH2 after they have been computed
   a) look for overlap in nearby groups
   b) group by theor_KMD_CH2, and examine the spread of KMD_CH2
   c) if overlap, eliminate conflicts and assign formulas to the most abundant of the remaining compounds?
   d) goal is to use results for formula assignment by KMD_CF2
