To-do list:

1. complete van Krevelen panel by class_element
2. revise VK plot for 25% groups to fix color to groups
3. create Kroll diagram
4. create function to eliminate LAS and other known laboratory contaminants once KMD series have been computed
5. create a plot for H/C vs C number, O/C vs C number, DBE (or DBE minus O) vs C number
6. create factor variable for mass ranges? (use pretty() or modulus 100 to set range)
7. create bar plot for factor variables as a function of rel. abund. &  formula number
8. create bar plot for heteroatom classes (Ox, NOx, N2Ox, etc.)
9. compute estimated carboxyls?
10. create DBE vs. O and DBE minus O frequency plots like Herzsprung?
11. create filter or test for improbable formula assignments?
12. test for inclusion in the element_list when computing elemental ratios: is there a need? see DBE & similar functions


Other:
1. perform a study comparing KMD_CH2 and theor_KMD_CH2 after they have been computed
   a) look for overlap in nearby groups
   b) group by theor_KMD_CH2, and examine the spread of KMD_CH2
   c) if overlap, eliminate conflicts and assign formulas to the most abundant of the remaining compounds?
   d) goal is to use results for formula assignment by KMD_CF2 and to screen CECs in biosolid samples
