To-do list:

1. test for inclusion in the element_list when computing elemental ratios: is there a need?
2. create function to eliminate LAS and other known laboratory contaminants once KMD series have been computed
3. perform a study comparing KMD_CH2 and theor_KMD_CH2 after they have been computed
   a) look for overlap in nearby groups
   b) group by theor_KMD_CH2, and examine the spread of KMD_CH2
   c) if overlap, eliminate conflicts and assign formulas to the most abundant of the remaining compounds?
   d) goal is to use results for formula assignment by KMD_CF2
