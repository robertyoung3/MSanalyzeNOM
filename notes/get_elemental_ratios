get_elemental_ratios

The following code works in dplyr if num and denom are not identified as character strings, but the :- operator is not recognized during CMD_CHECK (probably the {{}} operator is not recognized either)

  data %>% dplyr::mutate(
    "{{num}}to{{denom}}" := {{num}} / {{denom}}
  )

The previous code is inspired by https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html
